Timer
=====

What
----

This is a variation of the Hack and Tell Timer using seconds instead of minutes. I use it for timing iterations in Agile games like the [Lean Lego Game](http://www.dtsato.com/blog/work/lean-lego-game).

Who

Andrew Gwozdziewycz originally made this for [Hack and Tell](http://hackandtell.org) but used minutes instead of seconds.

Usage
-----

Just dump all the files in a directory and load up `index.html` in your browser. If you append `#45` to the url, you'll get a 45 second timer. It defaults to 30.

Double click on the time resets it. Single click pauses/unpauses.
